    <h2>Get to know me</h2>
    <p>As you would have noticed, my name is Kwanele (a Zulu name that means Enough) Ngobese my second name is Pearl! I am a 19 year old girl who lives in Pretoria, South Africa. I am an aspiring computational linguist, studying Linguistics and Psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. But before I am anything I am a child of God and I love Jesus. I grew up in a Christian home and I have grown to know God for myself apart from him being introduced to me by my mom</p>
    <h3>Random facts about me</h3>
    <p>I talk to myself and laugh at my own jokes! I love ice cream with all my heart, I want to be ice cream when I grow up (lol). I am very emotional, I cry (a lot). Anything else? Yes, a day does not end without me singing loud for no reason!Okay, that should be enough!</p>
